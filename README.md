## Problem Statement  
**Multimodal Scene Intent & Visual Planning Engine**

In film production, translating written scripts into concrete visual and emotional plans is a complex and manual process that depends heavily on individual interpretation. Directors and cinematographers must analyze narrative intent, emotional progression, character perspective, and visual language before filming begins. However, there is a lack of intelligent systems that can systematically assist in converting scripts into structured director’s notes, shot planning, and storyboard-level visual guidance while preserving creative control and cinematic authenticity.

## Objective

The objective of SceneSense AI is to assist filmmakers during the pre-production phase by transforming movie scripts into structured cinematic direction. The system aims to analyze scene intent, emotional flow, and character perspective to generate professional director-style notes, camera and shot plans, storyboard-ready visual instructions, and production-ready shot lists. The goal is to bridge the gap between written scripts and visual execution in a way that aligns with real filmmaking workflows.

## Project Overview

SceneSense AI takes a movie script as input and analyzes its emotional and narrative intent. It generates director-style guidance that includes emotional breakdowns, character analysis, camera planning, and visual direction. The system supports optional creative controls such as tone, scenario, and character point-of-view, enabling flexible interpretations of the same script. Based on this analysis, the project further produces storyboard planning instructions and structured shot lists suitable for pre-production use.

## Methodology

### 1. Script Input  
The user provides a movie script or scene along with optional creative parameters such as tone, scenario, or character point-of-view.

### 2. Scene Intent Analysis  
The system analyzes the script to identify primary emotions, emotional intensity, mood, narrative intent, and character emotional progression.

### 3. Director’s Notes Generation  
Structured director-style notes are generated, including emotional analysis, character focus, and cinematic direction.

### 4. Camera & Shot Planning  
A detailed shot plan is created, specifying shot types, camera movement, emotional purpose, and justification for each shot.

### 5. Storyboard Planning  
The shot plan is transformed into storyboard-ready visual instructions that define framing, composition, lighting, and atmosphere.

### 6. Shot Justification & Export  
Each shot is accompanied by professional justification and compiled into a production-ready shot list for pre-production use.
